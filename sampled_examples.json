        "question": "Nancy is crafting clay pots to sell. She creates 12 clay pots on Monday, twice as many on Tuesday, a few more on Wednesday, then ends the week with 50 clay pots. How many did she create on Wednesday?",
        "answer": "On Tuesday, Nancy creates 12 clay pots * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 clay plots.\nSo she created a combined total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 clay pots on Monday and Tuesday.\nSubtracting this from the number of clay pots she ended the week with means she must have created 50 \u2013 36 = <<50-36=14>>14 clay pots on Wednesday.\n#### 14"
